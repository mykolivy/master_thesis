Dear Prof. Joachim Weickert and Dr. Pascal Peter,

Reminder and notation:
 Event rate -- percentage of pixels that change their values from one frame to 
   another.
 Performance threshold -- upper bound for video event rate at which a proposed 
   compression method still outperforms the baseline.
 Formats in this report:
  + Pure AER -- designed to be as close to the standard definition of AER as
    possible.
    x (4 bytes), y (4 bytes), t (float), value(1 byte), polarity (1 byte)
  
  + CAER - same as Pure AER, but x,y aren't stored. Instead, all events for each
    of the pixels (starting from top left pixel and moving left-to-right,
    top-to-bottom) are listed together.
    [for pixel (0,0)]: t (float), value (1 byte), polarity(1 byte), ...,  0-byte 
    (indicating end of sequence for the current pixel)
	[for pixel (1,0)]: t, value, polarity, ..., 0-byte
	...

Short summary of my progress:
 + Modified performance threshold search to compute an average over multiple 
   runs, which allows for estimation on arbitrary video dimensions and lengths.
   These efforts proved to be in vain, as the script takes too long to run for
   any meaningful number of iterations.

 + For Pure AER, event threshold seems to peak at ~10% for 960x960 video,
   however it grows with the length of the video (not significantly).

   For CAER, threshold grows with bigger resolution and shorter length of the
   video. On a video with 960x960 resolution of length 1s, it reached ~39%

 + Analysed event rates for Virat dataset
   For 100 videos, present in the dataset, the average event rate is ~18%.
   Only 7 videos have a large event rate (>=40%), which makes compression with
   event representation inefficent. All the others have event rate < 39%.
   Roughly half of the videos (51) have event rate <= 15%.
   There are 40 videos with event rate <= 10%, which means that even pure AER
   representation can improve results from an entropy coder. 
  
   TODO: 
      - Some additional tests have to be performed to ensure validity of these
      results.
      - Analyze why 7% of videos have such high event rate.

   For now, conclusion is that event-based compression techniques should be 
   largely beneficial for this dataset.

 + Implemented lossy AER format
   Same as Pure AER, but with a global threshold.
   Events with value smaller or equal to the threshold are ignored.
   Consecutive ignored values are accumulated, until their sum is > threshold,
   in which case a new event with value of this sum is created at the current
   timestamp.
   With each new event written to the output, the sum of ignored values is reset

 + Started to familiarize myself with Tensorflow Keras


Although I am back to Saarbrucken, in view of current events, I would like to 
ask you for a remote meeting to discuss my further steps.

Thank you,
Yaroslav
