Definitions:
	event rate - for a video, average percentage of pixels changing values from
in each frame
	performance threshold - maximum rate, at which caer representation + entropy
coder improves compression ratio compared to plain entropy coder application

1. Modified codebase to make it more extendable
2. Incorporated lpaq1 and evaluated performance threshold for it
	- Threshold dropped from ~40% to ~36% (compared to regular paq on 64x64
	  resolution)
3. Ran same search on larger resolution sequences 
	+ Threshold depends on the resolution
	+ Threshold increases for larger resolutions
	+ Threshold increased to ~37.7% (128x128 resolution)
	+ Threshold increased to ~38% (256x256 resolution)
	- Threshold increase doesn't scale linearly with resolution (this
	  will be studied more thoroughly in the near future)
4. Found 3 interesting video datasets:
	+ VIRAT (https://viratdata.org/) - surveillance video dataset
	+ SynTex (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803798) - synthetic video
dataset 
	+ YouTube UGC (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06457) - database of
user-generated content from youtube. Contains an interesting idea that artifacts
in unproffessional videos shouldn't be reconstructed by decoder. An evaluation
method for reconstruction with no-reference objective is proposed
5. Downloaded 13 random videos from youtube dataset and computed average rate of
change for each of them 
	+ 4 out of 13 videos had very low rate (~24-26%), which is far below the
threshold determined earlier. These are videos with stable camera postition and
static background (podcast, kids playing table tennis...)

Summary:
Video resolution influences performance threshold.
Entropy coder influences performance threshold.
There exist user-generated videos for which the event rate is in good operating
range.

Use of event representation remains promising for sertain types of
user-generated sequences and for video survailance
