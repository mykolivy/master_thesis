Synthetic tests report

Created 3 synthetic sequences (5 sec, 30 fps, 64x64 pix):
	- single color sequence: all frames are the same
	- moving edge sequence: white edge moves from left to right over dark
	  background
	- random pixel sequence: each pixel values set independently for each frame

4 sequence representations compared:
	- raw: raw format, all frames concatenated to each other
	- mp4: compressed raw file with h.264 codec
	- aer: Address-Event representation of the sequence
	- caer: Compact Address-Event representation of the sequence (explained
	  later in CAER format section)

CAER format:
	Problem with AER: 
		It is costly to store (x,y) location of each event.
	Observation: 
		Vast majority of pixels in video sequences change their values at least
		once.
	Idea:
		Avoid storing locations -> CAER.
	Implementation:
		+ Save all event data for each pixel in sequence: left-to-right,
		  top-to-bottom.
		+ Denote the end of event stream for pixel by 0 byte.
		+ Only timestamp and delta is stored for each event
		- For pixels whose value never changes we still need to store a single
		  0-byte
